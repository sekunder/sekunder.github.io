In June 2025, Creighton held a workshop for faculty and staff titled "Educating the Whole Person in an AI-Driven World."
I served as co-leader for the technical track with [Steven Fernandes](https://steven-fernandes.com/). This page provides links to the slides used for our three sessions, together with additional reference material.
