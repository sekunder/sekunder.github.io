I am an assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics at [Creighton University](https://www.creighton.edu/), working in mathematical and computational neuroscience.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow of the National Library of Medicine Biomedical Informatics Training Program in the [laboratory for the algorithm brain](https://xaqlab.com/) and the [JosiÄ‡ Lab](https://www.math.uh.edu/~josic/).
I defended my PhD in combinatorics and discrete geometry with applications to neuroscience at Penn State in 2019 under the direction of [Vladimir Itskov](https://vitskov.github.io/homepage/).

In addition to my academic interests, I enjoy
using mathematics as a tool for creating beautiful sculptures.
