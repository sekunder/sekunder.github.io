I have no current serious plan to start a blog. I do, however, want to test the functionality of this blog system as well as several other features of academicpages, so I'm typing something here.

Now that I've put a bit of work into understanding this system (which is designed very well, so far as I can tell!) I'm realizing that I should have set up a website for the [github organization called kuninlab](https://github.com/kuninlab) that I just made. The goal would be to have a lab website and then this can be my personal website.
